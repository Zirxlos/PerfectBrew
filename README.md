## Introduction to the project

This project is reflecting my love for coffee and tea. I like to be able to 
experiment with new brewing methods or deviate from standard methods.
This project is a way for me to always have on-hand my favourite recipes 
(coffee-water ration, brew temperature).

## Notes about development

As this is a side project, it will get improvements on a non-regular basis. I start
this project with a very simplistic calculation for french-press brewing. It just 
returns the mass of water needed for x gram of coffee. It is just a basic calculation
for the moment but as the project will evolve, I will want to add the possibility to
access to an experimentation page, a tea page and a coffee page where there will be more information.

## Current version's capability

French press brew: calculate how much water is needed
Sencha green tea: calculate how much water is needed for two methods (trad and flash)
